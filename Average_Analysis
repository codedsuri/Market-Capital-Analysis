1. Third step in EDA is Emerging Companies based on logic if the share price of the company is more than 50% of the Average Share price of country of that country that company is categorised as 'Emerging' else 'Struggling'.
2. Cast function used to modify the data type of Price (USD) & MarketCap to Numeric type to use the window function.
3. SQL Concepts utilized to analyze the dataset are: Sub-Queries,Case Statement, Window Function- avg, Insert using Select Statement.
4. Given below is the script: 'Company_List' is original table imported in SSMS.

Select a.*
Into Average_Analysis
From
(
Select z.*,
(case when z.Price_Diff <= 0.50*z.Avg_Price
  Then 'Emerging'
   Else 'Struggling'
   End) as Growth_Status
   -- Adding a column for Growth of that company if the share price of the company is more than 50% of the Average Share price of country of that country that company
	from 
	 (Select y.*,
	   (Avg_Price-Cast_price) as Price_Diff, 
	   (case when y.Cast_price >= y.Avg_Price
		Then 'More'
		 Else 'Less'
		 End) as Cmp_AP
     --Cmp_AP is comparing if Share price < Average price of country of company the lable as 'Less' else 'More'
		 from
		  (
			Select x.Name, x.Symbol, x.Country, x.Cast_price, 
			avg(cast_price) over(partition by country) as Avg_Price
      --Find Average of country
			from
			 (
			  Select *, CAST(CAST(price_usd as float) as numeric(10,2)) as Cast_price
				from Company_List
        -- Modify Share Price into numeric data type
			 ) x
			) y
		)z
	Where z.Cmp_AP ='Less')a;

Select * from Average_Analysis --Check the Inserted records from above code

5.  Table created to Store the output is 'Average_Analysis'
Syntax:
Create Table Average_Analysis
( 
[Name] varchar(70),
Symbol Varchar(15), 
Country Varchar(30), 
Cast_price numeric(10,2), 
Avg_Price numeric(10,2),
Price_Diff numeric(10,2),
Cmp_AP Varchar(10),
Growth_Status Varchar (15)
);
